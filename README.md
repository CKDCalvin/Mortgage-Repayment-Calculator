## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I practices using the DOM more and learned how to implement a custom pop up error message.
Got better at researching areas I got stuck in. 

### Continued development

I will continue using the DOM and implementing event listeners.
